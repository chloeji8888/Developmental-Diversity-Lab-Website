                <strong>Description:</strong>
                Children’s Household-Environment Engagement Rating Scale: Based on the POPE, the CHEERS assesses a child’s
                level of engagement in the home. Trained video coders rated the child’s engagement level during two-minute intervals on
                five possible levels of engagement. The levels of engagement were inspired by levels of engagement on the POPE,
                examining previous research on children’s activities at home, and consulting with research faculty. The possible levels
                of engagement on the CHEERS are: (a) Isolated (b) Non-engaged. (c) Interactive non-reciprocal. (d) Reciprocal.<br>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                CHEERS was designed for Independent Evaluators to code child engagement in parent-recorded home videos pre- and
                post-intervention.
                <br>
                <strong>Development:</strong>
                Developed by Dr. Jeffrey Wood and Dr. John Danial.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                Autism-Related Characteristics Home Evaluation Rating (ARCHER) Scale. The ARCHER scale was developed as a measure of
                common Autism-related behaviors (ARBs) in the home environment. Unlike clinic-based assessments, ARCHER entails
                observation without standardized prompts and activities. These items were selected based on a review of the autism
                literature and commonly used measures of ARBs.
                <br>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                ARCHER was designed for Independent Evaluators to code child autism-related behaviors in parent-recorded home videos
                pre-and post-intervention.

                <br>
                <strong>Development:</strong>
                Development of the measure began with selection of relevant observable ARBs (see Danial, 2015; the measure was
                originally entitled SOARS).

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                The YTP symptom categories reflect a wide range of behavioral and symptomatic patterns associated with autism, as
                reported by caregivers.
                <br>
                <strong>Development:</strong>
                The YTP Symptom categories are 43 groups of problems derived from a full set of 287 caregiver-reported problems through
                inductive data reduction methods.
                <br>
                <strong>Examples:</strong>
                The YTP symptom categories encompass social communication (SC), restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB)s,
                externalizing and internalizing challenges.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                A one-hour interview for parents of children with autism that attempts to comprehensively identify personalized symptoms
                and treatment goals across most mental health settings while accounting for the heterogeneity of autism and functional
                domains.
                <br>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                The interview generates a symptom list of up to 12 per child, all in the parents' own words, and can be used to monitor
                short-term improvements in treatment and indicate when to switch clinical focus by attaining weekly ratings from the
                parents.

            <p id="meya-content-6" class="content" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Description:</strong>
            Video vignettes presented to children with autism that measured empathy through five distinct emotions: 1) sadness, 2)
            fear, 3) embarrassment, 4) anger, and 5) happiness. Children identified the emotion that the protagonist felt in each
            vignette, as well as described a time when they also felt that emotion. They also rated the strength (i.e., valence) of
            their feelings using a Likert scale.
            <br>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong>
            Throughout the presentation of video vignettes, children’s verbal responses, facial affect, and eye gaze were also coded
            to measure components of empathy such as prosocial motivation and perspective taking.
