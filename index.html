        <h1>Welcome to the MEYA Autism Program!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the MEYA Autism Program website, an innovative initiative dedicated to promoting positive
            practices and advancing clinical progress for a diverse range of children and youth on the spectrum. Also
            known as the Wood Lab, MEYA represents our commitment to inclusivity, collaboration, and transformative
            research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Led by Dr. Jeffrey Wood, a distinguished researcher in the field of autism research, our program draws upon
            contemporary cognitive neuroscience models and the memory retrieval competition perspective to develop
            groundbreaking intervention techniques. By leveraging insights from various areas of childhood
            psychopathology, such as emotional disorders and disruptive behavior disorders, we have created a
            comprehensive cognitive behavioral therapy program tailored specifically for school-aged children on the
            spectrum.
        </p>

        <h3>We are actively seeking California practitioners for a paid, remote, research opportunity.</h3>
