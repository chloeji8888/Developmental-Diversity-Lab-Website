            <p id="meya-content-1" class= "content"style="display: none;">
                The development and implementation of Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth with Autism (MEYA) represents a pivotal
                advancement in clinical training and decision-making for professionals working with youth on the spectrum. MEYA,
                stemming from the SEBASTIEN program, which evolved from Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children with Autism
                (BIACA), focuses on establishing strong alliances with patients and their families to create a collaborative and
                supportive environment. Through evidence-based interventions, MEYA aims to enhance self-regulation, promote adaptive
                behaviors, and address the diverse spectrum of personality traits, symptom expressions, and psychiatric comorbidities
                observed in children on the spectrum.
                <br></br>
                i. This comprehensive approach is exemplified in TAASD (Treatment for Anxiety in Autism Spectrum Disorders), a three-site
                randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a modular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol for
                anxiety in children on the spectrum compared to standard CBT and treatment-as-usual control. Additionally, SEBASTIAN,
                detailed in two papers, emphasizes modular cognitive-behavioral therapy for autism-related symptoms and personalized
                autism symptom assessment using the Youth Top Problems Scale. The overarching integration of evidence-based practices
                and personalized approaches showcased in MEYA and its predecessors contributes significantly to advancing the
                understanding and treatment of autism in diverse clinical settings.
                <br></br>
                ii. The CBT for Youth with Autism & Emotional/Behavioral Needs (CYAN) study plays a vital role in enhancing the well-being
                of children aged 6-14 years with autism and emotional dysregulation. This research, comparing cognitive behavioral
                therapy (CBT) to usual clinical care, focuses on improving therapeutic interventions for this population. The CBT manual
                employed in the study, known as MEYA, is well-supported by previous research and is readily accessible on the website,
                providing mental health clinicians with valuable resources for effective therapy sessions. Participating mental health
                clinicians not only contribute to the development and refinement of interventions for children on the spectrum and
                emotional dysregulation but also help determine the real-world benefits of CBT in various community mental health
                settings. This study aims to advance training procedures for mental health professionals working with individuals on the
                spectrum, contributing to the ongoing effort to enhance the quality of care for this diverse and often underserved
                population.

            <p id="meya-content-2" class="content"style="display: none;">
                Objective and personalized assessments of youth support needs and intervention outcomes are crucial for tailoring
                interventions to individual needs and understanding the diverse behavioral patterns associated with autism, fostering a
                comprehensive and effective approach to support and intervention strategies. The measures described, namely the
                Children’s Household-Environment Engagement Rating Scale (CHEERS), Autism-Related Characteristics Home Evaluation Rating
                (ARCHER) Scale, Youth Top Problems (YTP) Symptom Categories, and the YTP interview, share a common transdiagnostic theme
                focused on assessing and understanding various aspects of children's behavior and engagement within the home
                environment. The CHEERS evaluates a child’s engagement levels based on previous research and consultation with experts,
                aiming to provide independent evaluators with a tool to code child engagement in parent-recorded home videos pre- and
                post-intervention. ARCHER, on the other hand, measures common autism-related behaviors in the home environment,
                utilizing observations without standardized prompts. The YTP Symptom Categories encompass a broad range of behavioral
                and symptomatic patterns associated with autism, reported by caregivers. Finally, the YTP interview is a comprehensive
                one-hour session that aims to identify personalized symptoms and treatment goals for children with autism across various
                mental health settings, emphasizing a transdiagnostic approach to understanding and addressing the heterogeneity of
                autism in functional domains. These measures collectively contribute to a holistic understanding of children's
                behaviors, engaging in a transdiagnostic exploration that goes beyond specific diagnostic categories.

            <p id="meya-content-4" class="content" style="display: none;">
                When children exhibit appropriate responses to others in distress, this plays a positive role in their social
                functioning and helping behaviors. Autistic individuals may face challenges with the ability to discriminate between
                various emotional states and how to respond (Conner et al., 2018; Mazefsky & White, 2014). The study examined the
                relationship between self-regulation and empathy in school-age children (ages 7-13 years) with autism. This study
                utilized quantitative measures of self-regulation and empathy to analyze the association between factors of
                self-regulation and component-based domains of empathy. Results highlighted a significant association between the
                valence of an emotion (e.g., positive, or negative emotions) and levels of empathy. This work may inform future studies
                on the impact of self-regulation in children with autism as they reach school age.

            <h2 id="meya-title-5" class="title">Gender and Neurodiversity</h2>
            <p id="meya-content-5" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Autism diagnosis accuracy and occurrence varies significantly between males and females, identifying individuals at a
                ratio of 1 female to 4 males (Kirkovki, 2013). However, little is known about how diagnostic accuracy and experiences
                for autistic individuals differ based on gender identity and the barriers that keep one from receiving an initial
                diagnosis based on their gender identity. Four papers were written to examine this using mixed methodology. A
                quantitative exploration using the National Database of Autism Research found that out of the 5,000 children in the
                database, female consistently scored lower than males in every domain on the ADOS-II. Additionally, factory analyses
                revealed that the restrictive and repetitive questions were more strongly related to each factor in the male group.
                Secondly, qualitative research probed participants’ experiences with autism in relation to their gender identities
                through a series of interviews. Within 27 participants, themes of gender-differentiated symptom presentation and
                clinician bias revealed how gender socialization impacted females to camouflage their symptoms and how the stereotype of
                autism caused bias from families and clinicians. Lastly, these findings revealed that timing of gender diverse
                identities and autistic identity formations coincided and were linear, as the social difficulties reported by our sample
                included a lack of understanding of gendered themes.

            <p id="meya-content-6" class="content" style="display: none;">
                With many teens having to transition from a mainly educational system of support to a set of health and social service
                systems (Shattuck et al., 2017), there is a critical need to advance research and support services in the area of autism
                and transition to aid autistic individuals and their families. A series of interviews of autistic adults and
                stakeholders has been conducted to illuminate the struggles this population experiences during this time of transition
                and what changes could be made to the existing systems in place to improve outcomes in adulthood.

            <p id="meya-content-8" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Creators of social skills interventions (SSIs) for autistic youth often have the goal of teaching children how to act in
                different social situations with ultimate goals of “making friends, learning from others and developing hobbies,” of
                which many in the autistic advocate community dislike the pushing to adhere to neurotypical norms. As such, this
                research line explores how SSIs may not be aligned with the social goals of autistic youth. A systematic review of the
                recent 27 SSIs found that the social validity of their outcome measures was questionable and that the majority of
                interventions did not use the input of autistic advocates. With limited knowledge about what the social goals of
                autistic youth are, this series of research examines how autistic youth develop social resilience and what fulfills
                their social needs. A first examination found that within an online community of both neurotypical and neurodivergent
                individuals, those who have closer virtual friends reported higher rates of loneliness and higher rates of friendship
                closeness, compared to those with closer in-person friends. Secondly, a qualitative study interviewing autistic youth
                provides in-depth information about friendship formation, social needs, and social resilience.
