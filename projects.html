            <p id="meya-content-2" class="content" style="display: none;">
                We are conducting a research study that aims to improve the well-being of children aged 6-14 years with autism and
                emotional dysregulation, such as irritability and anxiety. The study involves comparing cognitive behavioral therapy
                (CBT) to usual clinical care.
                The CBT manual used in this study (MEYA) has been well-supported by previous research and is freely accessible on our
                website. It provides mental health clinicians with user-friendly digital and print materials to help them conduct
                therapy sessions effectively.
                By participating in this research study, mental health clinicians have the opportunity to contribute to the development
                and refinement of effective interventions for children with autism and emotional dysregulation. The study aims to
                determine the benefits of CBT in real-world clinical settings and improve training procedures for mental health
                professionals working with individuals on the autism spectrum. If you are interested in joining this study, we encourage
                you to learn more and consider becoming a valuable participant!

            <p id="meya-content-2" class="content"style="display: none;">
                Objective and personalized assessments of youth support needs and intervention outcomes are crucial for tailoring
                interventions to individual needs and understanding the diverse behavioral patterns associated with autism, fostering a
                comprehensive and effective approach to support and intervention strategies. The measures described, namely the
                Children’s Household-Environment Engagement Rating Scale (CHEERS), Autism-Related Characteristics Home Evaluation Rating
                (ARCHER) Scale, Youth Top Problems (YTP) Symptom Categories, and the YTP interview, share a common transdiagnostic theme
                focused on assessing and understanding various aspects of children's behavior and engagement within the home
                environment. The CHEERS evaluates a child’s engagement levels based on previous research and consultation with experts,
                aiming to provide independent evaluators with a tool to code child engagement in parent-recorded home videos pre- and
                post-intervention. ARCHER, on the other hand, measures common autism-related behaviors in the home environment,
                utilizing observations without standardized prompts. The YTP Symptom Categories encompass a broad range of behavioral
                and symptomatic patterns associated with autism, reported by caregivers. Finally, the YTP interview is a comprehensive
                one-hour session that aims to identify personalized symptoms and treatment goals for children with autism across various
                mental health settings, emphasizing a transdiagnostic approach to understanding and addressing the heterogeneity of
                autism in functional domains. These measures collectively contribute to a holistic understanding of children's
                behaviors, engaging in a transdiagnostic exploration that goes beyond specific diagnostic categories.

            <p id="meya-content-4" class="content" style="display: none;">
                When children exhibit appropriate responses to others in distress, this plays a positive role in their social
                functioning and helping behaviors. Autistic individuals may face challenges with the ability to discriminate between
                various emotional states and how to respond (Conner et al., 2018; Mazefsky & White, 2014). The study examined the
                relationship between self-regulation and empathy in school-age children (ages 7-13 years) with autism. This study
                utilized quantitative measures of self-regulation and empathy to analyze the association between factors of
                self-regulation and component-based domains of empathy. Results highlighted a significant association between the
                valence of an emotion (e.g., positive, or negative emotions) and levels of empathy. This work may inform future studies
                on the impact of self-regulation in children with autism as they reach school age.

            <p id="meya-content-5" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Autism diagnosis accuracy and occurrence varies significantly between males and females, identifying individuals at a
                ratio of 1 female to 4 males (Kirkovki, 2013). However, little is known about how diagnostic accuracy and experiences
                for autistic individuals differ based on gender identity and the barriers that keep one from receiving an initial
                diagnosis based on their gender identity. Four papers were written to examine this using mixed methodology. A
                quantitative exploration using the National Database of Autism Research found that out of the 5,000 children in the
                database, female consistently scored lower than males in every domain on the ADOS-II. Additionally, factory analyses
                revealed that the restrictive and repetitive questions were more strongly related to each factor in the male group.
                Secondly, qualitative research probed participants’ experiences with autism in relation to their gender identities
                through a series of interviews. Within 27 participants, themes of gender-differentiated symptom presentation and
                clinician bias revealed how gender socialization impacted females to camouflage their symptoms and how the stereotype of
                autism caused bias from families and clinicians. Lastly, these findings revealed that timing of gender diverse
                identities and autistic identity formations coincided and were linear, as the social difficulties reported by our sample
                included a lack of understanding of gendered themes.

            <p id="meya-content-6" class="content" style="display: none;">
                With many teens having to transition from a mainly educational system of support to a set of health and social service
                systems (Shattuck et al., 2017), there is a critical need to advance research and support services in the area of autism
                and transition to aid autistic individuals and their families. A series of interviews of autistic adults and
                stakeholders has been conducted to illuminate the struggles this population experiences during this time of transition
                and what changes could be made to the existing systems in place to improve outcomes in adulthood.

            <p id="meya-content-8" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Creators of social skills interventions (SSIs) for autistic youth often have the goal of teaching children how to act in
                different social situations with ultimate goals of “making friends, learning from others and developing hobbies,” of
                which many in the autistic advocate community dislike the pushing to adhere to neurotypical norms. As such, this
                research line explores how SSIs may not be aligned with the social goals of autistic youth. A systematic review of the
                recent 27 SSIs found that the social validity of their outcome measures was questionable and that the majority of
                interventions did not use the input of autistic advocates. With limited knowledge about what the social goals of
                autistic youth are, this series of research examines how autistic youth develop social resilience and what fulfills
                their social needs. A first examination found that within an online community of both neurotypical and neurodivergent
                individuals, those who have closer virtual friends reported higher rates of loneliness and higher rates of friendship
                closeness, compared to those with closer in-person friends. Secondly, a qualitative study interviewing autistic youth
                provides in-depth information about friendship formation, social needs, and social resilience.

                <p id="meya-content-1" class="content" style="display: none;">
                The development and implementation of Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth with Autism (MEYA) represents a
                pivotal
                advancement in clinical training and decision-making for professionals working with youth on the spectrum. MEYA,
                stemming from the SEBASTIEN program, which evolved from Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children with
                Autism
                (BIACA), focuses on establishing strong alliances with patients and their families to create a collaborative and
                supportive environment. Through evidence-based interventions, MEYA aims to enhance self-regulation, promote
                adaptive
                behaviors, and address the diverse spectrum of personality traits, symptom expressions, and psychiatric
                comorbidities
                observed in children on the spectrum.
                <br></br>
                i. This comprehensive approach is exemplified in TAASD (Treatment for Anxiety in Autism Spectrum Disorders), a
                three-site
                randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a modular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol
                for
                anxiety in children on the spectrum compared to standard CBT and treatment-as-usual control. Additionally,
                SEBASTIAN,
                detailed in two papers, emphasizes modular cognitive-behavioral therapy for autism-related symptoms and
                personalized
                autism symptom assessment using the Youth Top Problems Scale. The overarching integration of evidence-based
                practices
                and personalized approaches showcased in MEYA and its predecessors contributes significantly to advancing the
                understanding and treatment of autism in diverse clinical settings.
                <br></br>
                ii. The CBT for Youth with Autism & Emotional/Behavioral Needs (CYAN) study plays a vital role in enhancing the
                well-being
                of children aged 6-14 years with autism and emotional dysregulation. This research, comparing cognitive
                behavioral
                therapy (CBT) to usual clinical care, focuses on improving therapeutic interventions for this population. The
                CBT manual
                employed in the study, known as MEYA, is well-supported by previous research and is readily accessible on the
                website,
                providing mental health clinicians with valuable resources for effective therapy sessions. Participating mental
                health
                clinicians not only contribute to the development and refinement of interventions for children on the spectrum
                and
                emotional dysregulation but also help determine the real-world benefits of CBT in various community mental
                health
                settings. This study aims to advance training procedures for mental health professionals working with
                individuals on the
                spectrum, contributing to the ongoing effort to enhance the quality of care for this diverse and often
                underserved
                population.

                interactions. This study compared modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with enhanced standard community treatment
                (ESCT) in terms of impact on the severity of autism-related symptoms.

            <p id="meya-content-1" class="content" style="display: none;">
                In developing psychological intervention programs for autistic youth, our research focus began with anxiety as a primary
                emphasis (Sze & Wood, 2007, 2008; Wood et al., 2009a) and then expanded to also include social and other important foci
                (Wood et al., 2009b, 2021, 2022, 2024). Results from our 3-site clinical trial of a 16-week intervention program
                entitled Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children on the Autism Spectrum (BIACA; Wood et al., 2020) suggest that
                for outcomes ranging from anxiety to social responsiveness, BIACA outperformed both standard CBT as well as
                treatment-as-usual across multiple measures (Wood et al., 2020). Similar findings on BIACA have been reported by an
                independent research group (Storch et al., 2013, 2015). We then developed an expanded evidence-based intervention
                program, Schema-, Emotion, and Behavior-Focused Therapy for Children (SEBASTIEN; meya.ucla.edu), comprehensively
                addressing family-defined high priority clinical needs across most psychological and behavioral domains (mental health,
                social engagement, friendship, flexibility, and self-care) in a systematic fashion. SEBASTIEN uses measurement-based
                care and a modular design to personalize intervention for each child and family. It has also been designed for
                implementation in community care settings (see next section) and has been the focus of two randomized clinical trials
                (e.g., Wood et al., 2014; 2021; 2022). In these studies, independent ratings of youth social engagement during school
                recess and during 10 hours of videotaped daily life at home per family, as well as parent ratings of “youth top
                problems” over the course of intervention, were used to evaluate the outcomes of SEBASTIEN, and across these measures,
                SEBASTIEN consistently outperformed a group therapy condition focusing on social skills and self-regulation.

                Individuals with fewer initial resources (e.g., many children attending urban schools) tend to receive fewer services
                even when they have a high level of mental health need. We have written about the prospects for school-based mental
                health services to overcome these systemic barriers, irrespective of family background (e.g., Langer et al., 2015; Wood
                et al., 2008). We have developed a free internet-based practitioner training protocol entitled MEYA (Modular EBPs for
                Youth on the Autism Spectrum) to facilitate implementation of evidence-based interventions for autistic youth being
                served in community settings (https://meya.ucla.edu). The training program appears to support practitioner adherence and
                competence in evidence-based practices (Wood et al., 2024). We are currently engaged in research funded by the United
                States Department of Defense Autism Research Program to study the effectiveness of this training program and its
                constituent therapy/counseling practices in California service settings such as public schools, community mental health
                clinics, regional centers, and military health centers.

            <h3 id="meya-title-1" class="title">Assessment of Social Engagement, Mental Health, and Other Clinical Needs in Youth on the Autism Spectrum</h3>
            <p id="meya-content-1" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Some of our earlier work focused on the construct validity of clinical anxiety in the context of autism (e.g., Wood &
                Gadow, 2010; Lecavalier, Wood, et al., 2014; Renno & Wood, 2013). More recent work has emphasized personalized
                assessment of clinical needs in youth on the spectrum and the use of video-based observation methods in the home setting
                to assess social engagement and parent-child relationships in families of autistic youth. Expanding beyond traditional
                questionnaire measures with limited scope, mixed evidence of validity, and sometimes marginal relevance to intervention
                planning has been the underlying emphasis of this line of research. We have found that it is possible for caregivers to
                define clinical goals for their autistic children across multiple domains (mental health, social engagement, friendship,
                flexibility, and self-care) in a way that is efficient, psychometrically valid, and sensitive to psychosocial
                intervention (e.g., BIACA, SEBASTIEN, as noted above; e.g., Wood et al., 2022). Equally importantly, such measures can
                be used to help practitioners and families prioritize intervention emphasis and track treatment response efficiently to
                assist in determining when to shift the focus of treatment (e.g., when to shift the focus from self-regulation skills to
                friendship development) (Wood et al., 2024). This type of measurement-based care is a central element to the MEYA
                training program mentioned above (https://meya.ucla.edu), giving practitioners a tool for selecting intervention foci
                and for receiving automated guidance on shifting from one clinical emphasis to another.

            <h3 id="meya-title-1" class="title">Cognitive Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety, OCD, and Depression</h3>
            <p id="meya-content-1" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Children with clinically impairing anxiety have been characterized as having several ecological risk factors that are
                potentially malleable via interventions: (a) specific patterns of parent-child interactions that may inadvertently
                support clinical anxiety, and (b) social difficulties with peers that may serve to maintain clinical anxiety as a result
                of stress, stigma, and poor social self-efficacy. While first generation cognitive behavioral intervention programs
                targeted children’s emotion regulation and attention biases towards threat cues, less attention was focused directly on
                ecological risk factors. It was suspected that addressing the environment in which children became anxious might enhance
                treatment effects. This program of research began with a literature review (Wood et al., 2003) and meta-analysis
                (McLeod, Wood, & Weisz, 2004) showing that intrusive and rejecting parenting were linked with anxiety symptoms in
                children, as well as descriptive and longitudinal research documenting similar trends with measures of parenting
                developed in our lab (e.g., Wood, 2006; Wood et al., 2004, 2007) which have been used in replications and extensions of
                this research program by others in ensuing years (e.g., Raudino et al., 2013). We developed a cognitive behavioral
                therapy (CBT) program to augment standard CBT practices with an explicit focus on intrusive and rejecting parenting and
                positive relationships with peers (Wood & McLeod, 2008), and in an RCT, compared it to a standard-of-care CBT program
                for childhood anxiety, finding that the augmented program outperformed the standard-of-care in terms of independent
                evaluators’ ratings of treatment response and anxiety severity at posttreatment and 1-year followup (Wood et al., 2006,
                2009), and that reductions in parental intrusiveness during treatment mediated the children’s improved clinical status
                at 1-year-follow-up (Wood et al., 2009).

            <h3 id="meya-title-1" class="title">Emotion Regulation, Social Adjustment, and Schooling</h3>
            <p id="meya-content-1" class="content" style="display: none;">
                Mental health challenges have implications for youth adjustment in numerous domains, and one of the most consequential
                of the potential effects is in the domain of schooling—both academic performance and school attendance. We have
                completed several studies examining linkages between anxiety (and emotion regulation), peer acceptance and friendship,
                and academic outcomes and school attendance (e.g., Wood et al., 2012; Wood, 2006, 2007; Galla, Wood et al., 2014). These
                studies have demonstrated linkages between anxiety and close relationships with peers, and between anxiety (and emotion
                regulation) and school adjustment and success, among children and adolescents. Several of these are especially
                noteworthy due to their longitudinal design (e.g., Wood et al., 2012—published in Child Development; Wood,
                2006—published in Developmental Psychology). In these studies, generally using panel designs and two or more timepoints
                of data collected with intervals of months or years, a number of important findings emerged at the within and between
                person levels. For example, the more that anxiety decreased (or capacity for emotion regulation increased) over time for
                a child, the more the child’s academic performance tended to increase in these studies. A similar pattern of findings
                was identified for social adjustment. Previous studies in the literature have often relied on concurrent assessments of
                these constructs to provide support for the hypothesis that anxiety impairs academic and social adjustment, but have
                been unable to test for dynamic associations over time. Children with clinically impairing anxiety also often experience
                significant school avoidance (e.g., Wood, 2006). To better understand the relation between anxiety, emotion regulation,
                and attendance, we developed a conceptual model of the determinants and consequences of attendance problems among youth
                in urban schools (e.g., Wood, 2007). In a longitudinal study conducted on three separate national datasets, high levels
                of absenteeism in a previous year yielded a higher probability of meeting clinical criteria for externalizing and
                internalizing problems in the following year for youth attending US middle schools using a cross-lagged regression
                design (Wood et al., 2012). Based on these findings and others, it appears that a bi-directional relationship between
                mental health needs and school absenteeism can develop for youth, with implications for preventive intervention.
