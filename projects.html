                We are conducting a research study that aims to improve the well-being of children aged 6-14 years with autism and
                emotional dysregulation, such as irritability and anxiety. The study involves comparing cognitive behavioral therapy
                (CBT) to usual clinical care.
                <br></br>
                The CBT manual used in this study (MEYA) has been well-supported by previous research and is freely accessible on our
                website. It provides mental health clinicians with user-friendly digital and print materials to help them conduct
                therapy sessions effectively.
                <br></br>
                By participating in this research study, mental health clinicians have the opportunity to contribute to the development
                and refinement of effective interventions for children with autism and emotional dysregulation. The study aims to
                determine the benefits of CBT in real-world clinical settings and improve training procedures for mental health
                professionals working with individuals on the autism spectrum. If you are interested in joining this study, we encourage
                you to learn more and consider becoming a valuable participant!

            - Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth with Autism (MEYA)
            ​<br></br>
            - MEYA is a comprehensive clinical training and clinical-decision-making personal assistant for clinicians working with
            youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in outpatient settings, hosted at UCLA.
            ​<br></br>
            - With MEYA, our primary focus is to establish a strong alliance with our patients and their families, fostering a
            supportive and collaborative environment. Through our evidence-based interventions, we aim to enhance self-regulation,
            promote adaptive behaviors in social and academic contexts, and address the wide spectrum of personality traits, symptom
            expressions, and psychiatric comorbidities often observed in children with ASD.
